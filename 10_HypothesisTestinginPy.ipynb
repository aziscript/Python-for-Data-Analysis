    "### What is Hypothesis Testing?\n",
    "Imagine you‚Äôre a detective trying to figure out whether something is true or not. Hypothesis testing is like running an experiment to check if your guess (hypothesis) about something is actually correct. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1: Video Game Experiment (A/B Testing)\n",
    "In 2013, the company that made the video game *SimCity 5* wanted more people to pre-order their game (buy it before it was released). They had two ideas for their game‚Äôs website:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Version 1 (Control):** The website had a banner saying, ‚ÄúBuy now and get money off your next purchase.‚Äù\n",
    "2. **Version 2 (Treatment):** The website had no banner‚Äîjust a simple page to pre-order the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "They tested both versions by randomly showing half of their visitors Version 1 and the other half Version 2. Then, they counted the number of people who actually bought the game on each page. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Surprise!** More people (43% more!) bought the game from the version without the banner. Weird, right? The company thought the banner would help, but it actually hurt sales! \n",
    "\n",
    "The big question they had was: _‚ÄúIs this 43% difference real or just a random fluke?‚Äù_ That's where hypothesis testing comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2: Data Scientist Salaries\n",
    "Now imagine someone wants to figure out how much data scientists get paid, on average. They guess (hypothesize) the average salary is **$110,000**. But then they look at a small sample of data scientists and find their average salary is **$120,000**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next question is: _‚ÄúIs this difference in salary ($120,000 vs. $110,000) real, or did it happen just by chance?‚Äù_ \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Do They Check if the Difference is Real?\n",
    "They use a few tools and steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Bootstrap Distribution**: This is like shaking up a jar of data, pulling out random samples over and over, and writing down each sample's average. This helps figure out what \"normal\" differences in salary might look like.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Imagine it like baking cookies and tasting different batches to see how much their taste varies.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Standard Error**: This is a fancy way of measuring how much numbers in the jar (sample) tend to jump around. If the jar‚Äôs values don‚Äôt jump much, even a small difference is meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Z-Score**: This tells you how far your result (like $120,000) is from your guess ($110,000), compared with what you consider normal (the standard error). \n",
    "\n",
    "   - If the z-score is very big, it means your result is far from what you guessed, and you might need to rethink your guess. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Does This Matter?\n",
    "Hypothesis testing helps answer two important questions:\n",
    "1. Is something meaningful or just a coincidence? In the EA example, did the sales difference happen by chance, or was removing the banner really better?\n",
    "2. Should we believe what we guessed? In the salary example, is $110,000 a good guess for the average salary, or does the data say otherwise?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like a fairness check for decisions:\n",
    "- It helps companies make better choices (like which website version works better).\n",
    "- It helps people understand whether numbers mean something or are just random."

    "\n",
    "The `late_shipments` dataset contains supply chain data on the delivery of medical supplies. Each row represents one delivery of a part. The `late` column denotes whether or not the part was delivered late. A value of `\"Yes\"` means that the part was delivered late, and a value of `\"No\"` means the part was delivered on time.\n",

    "Okay, imagine you want to know if something is different between two groups of people. This video explains how to do that using a statistical test called a \"t-test.\" It's like a detective trying to figure out if two suspects are really different, or if the differences you see are just random chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **The Question:** We want to know if there's a real difference in something (like salary) between two groups (like people who started coding as kids versus adults).\n",
    "*   **The Guess (Null Hypothesis):** We start by assuming there's NO real difference between the groups. This is our \"innocent until proven guilty\" assumption. In our example, it means assuming kids and adults make the same average salary.\n",
    "*   **The Evidence (Sample Data):** We collect information from both groups (e.g., salaries from a sample of coders).\n",
    "*   **Calculate Averages:** We find the average salary for each group in our sample.\n",
    "*   **The T-Statistic:** This is a special number that tells us how different the groups are, taking into account how much the salaries vary within each group and how many people are in each group. It's like a \"difference score\" that is adjusted for how reliable the data is.\n",
    "*   **Big T-Statistic = Potentially Important Difference:** A bigger t-statistic suggests the groups are more different than we'd expect if the \"no difference\" guess was true. A small t-statistic suggests the groups might not be very different.\n",
    "*   **Standard Error:** This measures how much the average salary of each sample group might vary from the true average.\n",
    "*   **Next Steps:** After calculating the t-statistic, you'd use it to figure out the \"p-value\" (covered in the next video). The p-value helps you decide whether you have enough evidence to reject your initial \"no difference\" guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have two basketball teams, and you want to know if one is better than the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Null Hypothesis:** Both teams are equally good on average.\n",
    "*   **Evidence:** You watch a few games and record the scores for each team.\n",
    "*   **Calculate Averages:** You find the average score for each team in the games you watched.\n",
    "*   **The T-Statistic:** The t-statistic considers the difference in average scores, how much the scores varied from game to game for each team, and the number of games you watched. A big difference, with consistent scores, would give a bigger t-statistic.\n",
    "*   **Next Steps:** You use the t-statistic and other information to figure out how likely it is that the difference you saw in the games was just luck, or if one team is truly better.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In simple terms, the t-test helps you decide if the differences you see between two groups are real or just due to random chance.** It does this by calculating a t-statistic, which considers the difference between the group averages, how much the data varies, and the number of observations in each group."
